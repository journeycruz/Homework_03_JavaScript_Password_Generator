# Password_Generator

In this assignment I created a password generator that will ask the user to confirm what criteria to use in their password and generate one based on the information they provide. 

When the user clicks generate. They will be prompted to enter how many characters they would like their password to be followed by a series of alert boxes to ask what characters to include in their password. The user is allowed to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numeric characters, and special characters. 

After the user is done entering their criteria for their password, a password will be written to the page.
